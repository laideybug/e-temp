# e-temp
A bash script to output the current temperature of the Zynq chip on a Parallella board. It can be used as a lightweight alternative to *xtemp*.

### Usage
1. The script requires **bc** to work so get it with "apt-get install bc" if it's not already installed.
2. Modify user permissions with chmod as required (e.g. chmod 775 /path/to/file).
3. Run with './e-temp.sh'.
